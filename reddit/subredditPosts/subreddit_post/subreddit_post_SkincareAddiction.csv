Have searched everything I can to see if this has happened to anywhere else, and my GP has not been helpful about this issue in the past. I've had six months of problems with ringworm on my body, and got to the point in February where it was on my face continuously. I stopped using epiduo in December, as from there whenever I used it I would get a new ringworm colony on my face. I stopped everything on my face until the middle of April, where I started with a 3-month cause of lymecycline and began using epiduo again every 2-3 days. However, this morning I woke up with ringworm on my face again :( I thought perhaps as the benzoyl peroxide and the antibiotics I'm taking kill bacteria, it's therefore not keeping any fungus on my face 'in check' and in balance but my GP seemed unconvinced by this and I can't find anything online to suggest this!

Honestly, the most basic core of skincare is moisturizing after all. It’s important to use products with certain ingredients depending on your age or skin concerns, but you don’t always need to spend money on products with a ton of ingredients, especially if you don’t have any specific skin issues.

Personally, I’ve tried both expensive products and affordable dupes. Some high-end products definitely impressed me, but I’ve also found that there are budget-friendly options that work just as well, if not better. In many cases, the key is the ingredients, and you don’t need to pay for extra marketing or fancy packaging when a simpler formula does the job.

If you're looking for cost-effective beauty products, I actually recommend checking out Daiso rather than Olive Young. Olive Young is great when you're in Korea, but Daiso is a hidden gem. Most of the products there are made by the same brands you’ll find in Olive Young, but they’re way more affordable and still deliver great results.

It’s all about finding what works for your skin, whether it’s a splurge or a dupe.",1749026447.0,0,4,t2_1poolxfbj0,Strange_Storage_214,https://www.reddit.com/user/Strange_Storage_214

1l2z940,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l2z940/routine_help_how_i_apply_my_skincare_for_best/,"Over the years, I’ve learned a few tricks to make sure my skincare routine actually works. Here’s what’s been helping me get the most out of my products:

1. Light to Heavy, Water to Oil Start with the lightest, most watery products (like toners or serums) and finish with the heaviest (like oils or creams). This way, everything absorbs better and doesn’t sit on top of your skin.
2. Let Each Product Absorb After applying each product, gently tap your skin with your fingertips to help it sink in. Don’t rush, give it a minute or so before moving to the next step.
3. Clean Hands, Always I make sure to wash my hands before applying anything to my face. It sounds simple, but it keeps my skincare clean and free from bacteria.
4. Prep Your Skin with a Water Mask Before putting on any products, I’ll do a quick just water mask. It’s super easy, just soak a cotton pad with soft water (not regular tap water) and leave it on your skin for about 5-10 minutes. It helps my skin get ready for everything else and gives my products a better chance to work.
5. Switch It Up With the Seasons I don’t use the same products year-round. In winter, I go for thicker creams and richer moisturizers. In summer, I opt for lighter, gel-based products to avoid clogging my pores.
6. Apply Right After Washing Right after I wash my face, I get to my skincare routine fast. My skin’s still a little damp, which helps the products soak in better and work more effectively.

Hope this helps! It’s all about layering and making sure your skin’s prepped and ready to absorb. Let me know if you’ve tried any of these tips!",1749021326.0,3,1,t2_e41dfr0o,Yoongteol,https://www.reddit.com/user/Yoongteol

What I did was I just stayed on a skincare set and trusted the process and soaked my skin with moisturizer, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid!

The skincare set I am using is a brand from the Philippines-&gt; Dr Alvin rejuvenating set I know rejuvenating sets are often frowned upon but it works for me! I first started with a month with the rejuvenating set and I am not on the maintenance set. I think this set contains retinol or tretinoin I am not exactly sure 😂

Here’s my routine:

Dr Alvin soap 
Dr Alvin toner 
Cosrx Niacinamide 15 
The Organic Pharmacy Hyaluronic acid
Aveeno calm and restore moisturizer 
Dr Alvin maintenance cream 
Aveeno moisturizer again
BOJ eye serum (not sure if it's working Imao)

I recently moved here in the UK and was trying to find another skincare brand I could easily buy here since I am using a Filo brand which isn't really available, so I tried to use beauty of josen (ginseng toner, glow deep serum, revive serum) and omygod after a few days I started getting tiny red bumps so I was like nope, don't fix what isn't broken, I guess I am forever staying with the routine I am in 🥹

Anyways I really love the cosrx niacinamide and how effective it is with diminishing dark spots and hyperpigmentation! Due to the small bumps I gained from BOJ I realised I still was not able to get rid of my habit of picking on my skin and made the small bumps worse but after 4 days or so they all disappeared eventually.

The Organic Pharmacy Hyaluronic is also so nice and is easily absorbed by my skin! It's got a very watery consistency and makes my skin very plump and bouncy, kind of like a soft boiled egg hahaha


Also during the morning I only use BOJ sunscreen!


As a person with oily skin, I really thought I should stay away from moisturizing my skin too much but the moment I tried it, it saved my skin soooo much.

So pls pls pls, soak ur skin with moisture and your skin will thank you in the long run!

Hope this guide helps!

Acne history- did accutane at 16 and then had perfect skin until about 23. Started breaking out here and there so decided to try adapalene gel last year for four months. Skin looked the same/a little worse so decided to stop it. Breakouts continued so I went to the derm in January. She put me on a combo of stuff including clindamyacin, Sulfacetamide and Sulfur face wash, salicylic acid face wash, and dapsone. Something caused a bad reaction so I had to take doxycycline which cleared my skin up completely. Didn’t want to be on an antibiotic long term so I stopped and tried the face wash and clindamyacin again. Didn’t work so we tried ivermectin for a month to see if it was type II rosacea which only broke me out more. Now I am back to a very simple routine but everyday I get these new small white pustules. 

Current routine:
AM- LRP Toleriane face wash, hypochloris acid spray, elta md sunscreen, non comodegenic makeup
PM- LRP Toleriane face wash, hypochloris acid spray, tower 28 moisturizer

1l2p1c8,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l2p1c8/sunscreen_recs_sun_care_product_request/,"I'm sure everyone agrees that a 100% perfect sunscreen is one of the hardest products to find. I've gone through hundreds, possibly thousands, of dollars and tens of products looking for the right sunscreen, and I haven't found it. I'm looking for sunscreens that don't give that ""glass skin"" look (I have acne so it just makes me look greasy). I need it to double as moisturizer so I don't have to put more than one thing on my face in the morning, because that would risk pilling and ineffectiveness. And I need it to be for dry/combo skin. I'm always dry in my chin/mouth area, normal in my cheek area, and super oily in my forehead and nose area. Here are the sunscreens I've tried over the past couple years and my reviews of them:

\-La Roche Posay Toleriane Mositurizer W/ SPF 30: SOOOO greasy. So fucking greasy. Made me look so sweaty and greasy. Do not let this get near your eyes it will BURN like hell. Absolute worst sunscreen I've tried.

\-La Roche Posay Mineral/Tinted Mineral W/ SPF 50: Tinted version turns you orange, mixing them might be OK, but even with a moisturizer they make you look cakey. And they left me feeling dry.

\-EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46: Great! Only if you find a moisturizer that doesn't pill with it! Which is basically impossible. Without a moisturizer it leaves me feeling dry. Great for acne/oily prone skin and redness though. This sunscreen has pilled more than any other sunscreen I've used. Don't even think about getting the tinted version if you're pale.

\-EltaMD Post-Procedure/Recovery (SPF 40/50? I think they changed the labelling on this product): Great as a moisturizer+sunscreen! But leaves me feeling so so greasy. And makes me look sweaty asf. If you don't have acne/acne-prone skin I 100% recommend this sunscreen. My skincare addict aunt uses this everyday, she's almost 50 and still looks like she's in her early 30's and very moisturized.

\-Round Labs Birch Juice SPF 45: Best sunscreen I've tried, might give this a second chance to be honest. If I use something like niacinamide under it, it leaves my skin feeling dry, and if I use nothing it leaves me feeling greasy. Now that I've got my acne a bit more under control (thank you Cabtreo) we'll see how it goes.

\-Hero Cosmetics Force Shield (Green Tinted) SPF 30: It's OK. Didn't make me feel dry or greasy, a great in-between! Only if it didn't make me look incredibly incredibly pale. It's great for covering up red areas, but I was told I looked incredibly pale (pale as in close to throwing up) when I used it. Do not use if you have warm/neutral undertones like me. Also, it smells FUCKING AMAZING. So good. Best smelling sunscreen I've EVER used.

\-Hero Cosmetics Force Shield (Bronze Tinted) SPF 30: I don't think they even sell this version anymore, but in case they do and you wanted to buy it, DON'T. Unless you're the exact same shade as the sunscreen or a bit darker you will look weird compared to the rest of your body. Also does not smell as good as it's green counterpart. Hero cosmetics is an amazing brand for acne prone/sensitive skin though!

\-CeraVe Lightweight Sunscreen: It's OK, it's what I'm currently using. It's just not moisturizing enough to use as a moisturizer+sunscreen. Not notable at all.",1748988718.0,3,5,t2_1nyxr5kpej,BuzzzedAgain,https://www.reddit.com/user/BuzzzedAgain

I introduced it slowly using the sandwich method that I've seen a lot of people propose, but after six months there was no improvement and it actually made my skin a lot worse, probably the worst it's ever been.

I'm wondering if there's anything I can do currently to help the process because I'm really not sure if my skin is getting better at all. As you can see in the photos I'm experiencing redness, large raised pimples that stay for a long time, along with the smaller bumps that go along my hairline and forehead. I've made a dermatologist appointment but they're booked up for a decent amount of time, so I'm just seeing what I could do until I can get in. 

Additionally I'm also wondering if anyone has experience getting rid of existing razor bumps like in the last picture.
