1l23hyt,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l23hyt/routine_help_baby_oil_baby_powder_moisturizer/,"I got into Korean skincare recently and started a routine with basically the same AM/PM routine (oil cleanse only in PM).

I used to wash and moisturize with Cetaphil products (and then baby powder on top because I didn't like the greasiness) for years until I got an allergic reaction for some reason (skin and eyes were puffy) and switched to washing just with water and using Glaxal base lotion until my face calmed down.

Now I oil cleanse with J&amp;J baby oil (PM only), water cleanse with Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser, use BoJ Green Plum Refreshing Toner, then moisturize with Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream.

I'm on my second month of this routine. My texture is better, barrier is restored, and people tell me I have the dewy glow/glass skin, but I think it's just me being oily without the baby powder...

I'm just wondering if baby powder is ok as the last step to skin care? Or is it absorbing/cancelling out my moisturizer? Also is baby oil ok for oil cleansing?

I'm also starting to think the Round Lab cream is too heavy for summer. I'm getting small whiteheads from being too oily as it gets warmer out. This cream might be better in the winter (because I get frequent wind burn too when I dry out).

Recs for summer moisturizer?

Note: I did the skin type test (cleansed + waited 2 hours) and I think I have normal/combo sensitive skin?

Note 2: Never wore sunscreen until now and use Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Mild-Up Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++ just in the afternoon when I go home. Sun isn't up when I leave in the AM (UV 0).

1l23776,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l23776/acne_what_finally_worked_for_my_acneprone_skin/,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share something deeply personal today, not just to tell my story, but in hopes that someone reading this who is struggling like I was might find a bit of light at the end of the tunnel.

I have always battled acne. Not just the occasional pimple, but full-blown cystic breakouts that felt like they were in control of my self-worth. I remember avoiding mirrors, turning down invites, and mastering the art of fake laughter because the thought of someone really looking at me made my chest tighten. I tried so many products, routines, and so-called holy grail hacks, but my skin would either dry out, break out more, or just look dull and tired.

It wasnâ€™t until I shifted my mindset from ""how do I get rid of this overnight"" to ""how can I heal my skin gently and consistently"" that things began to change.

Hereâ€™s what finally made the difference for me:

**Gentle exfoliation and deep cleansing:** I started my mornings with a cleanser that used natural salicylic acid. What surprised me was not just how clean my skin felt, but the fact that it did not feel stripped. My skin stayed soft, hydrated, and fresh, and over a few weeks, the angry under-the-skin breakouts started fading. My pores began looking smaller, and the oiliness became balanced.

**A toner that did not sting:** I had been traumatized by toners that felt like rubbing alcohol. But this one was different. It was soothing yet effective. With ingredients like grape water and rose water, it calmed my skin while gently minimizing oil and blackheads. It became a moment of self-care I actually looked forward to.

**Moisturizer that hydrates without the grease:** If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you know the struggle of finding a moisturizer that does not make things worse. This lightweight one I found is olive squalane based, and it truly feels like a drink of water for the skin. No heaviness, no clogged pores, just balanced hydration and a natural matte finish. It helped smooth out my texture and made me feel confident even without makeup.

**A glycolic essence that brightens the skin:** I will be honest. I was skeptical of essences. But this one turned out to be my favorite step. It gently exfoliates dead skin and helps the rest of the routine work better. I used it consistently before my serum, and over time, the dark spots from past breakouts began to fade. It did not happen overnight, but it happened. And that gave me hope.

I did not expect skincare to become a form of therapy. But these small, mindful steps like cleansing without punishment and treating my skin with patience helped me fall back in love with my reflection. Now I get compliments on my skin, and I do not panic when someone pulls out their camera. That is something I never thought I would say.

If anyone is feeling overwhelmed, just know that your skin does not define your worth. But taking care of it with love can absolutely help you feel more like yourself. It took time, research, and a lot of trial and error, but I found a routine that finally feels right for me.

I am happy to share more details about what I used or how I layered everything if anyone is curious. Just wanted to post this in case it helps someone feel less alone in their journey.

First two pics are now, last pic was from a week ago (sorry for bad pic wasnâ€™t expected to do before and after). So recently I started using the new effaclar duo dual action acne cleanser thatâ€™s 4% benzoyl peroxide from la roche posay (I just found out they retired the old dual acne treatment which was 5.5%). The old treatment always worked wonders for me. My forehead has always been pretty smooth, with occasional closed comedones. However, after starting this new cleanser my forehead has gotten extremely textured in the past week with several closed comedones. No where else on my face has reacted like this (but I donâ€™t break out in comedones really anywhere else but my nose sometimes). I tried using differin 10% benzoyl as well because I was wondering if the percentage wasnâ€™t enough but it hasnâ€™t helped (but it has been working on a couple pimples I had on my chin). This is in addition to using niacinamide serum and la roche posay moisturizer (which do not bother me/have never bothered me in the past). I am wondering if i should STOP using this products and if so what to use instead? Or if this is simply purging of closed comedones on my forehead since benzoyl peroxide is supposed to clear those out. 

I am never a huge skin care user aside from cleansing my face with SA cleanser. I only started using these products because my menstrual cycle was causing me to break out on my chin, and the benzoyl peroxide treatment in the past always worked great for me.

What Iâ€™m looking for is a sunscreen that isnâ€™t water resistant as I prefer to keep things minimal and not have to double cleanse. I want a sunscreen that wonâ€™t leave my skin super shiny but also wonâ€™t leave a white cast, and that has an SPF of at least 50. If itâ€™s moisturizing thatâ€™s a plus but that may render my non-shiny requirement impossible. These may all seem like easy get-arounds, but on top of all this I live in the United States. Iâ€™ve been on tretinoin as a precautionary protocol after finishing up accutane and am in dire need of a sunscreen. I used the Cerave ultra light lotion with SPF 30 for a while but found that due to the lower SPF count I had to apply a lot and it made my face greasy.",1748922162.0,3,5,t2_1m9yy6fhx4,Acceptable_Deer8745,https://www.reddit.com/user/Acceptable_Deer8745

Hello! I'm 33 yo and I'm 9 months postpartum and when I stopped breastfeeding about 5 months in, my skin turned on me!

I was blessed with beautiful, glowing skin during my pregnancy, yet I've always struggled with mild acne since I was about 20. I have sensitive, combo skin. I can have dry, flaky eyelids and a chin so greasy you might see your reflection depending on the day ðŸ™ƒ

But this is starting to get out of hand. I have painful cysts all over my back, especially lower back. I have had several eczema flair ups that may disappear for a few days or weeks then reappear, angry as ever (mostly on my hands). And I havent had a trace of eczema in over 6 years or so. But my face is really starting to mess with my self confidence (which if you know pp, you know self love can be tough to feel) and it just hurts! Between black heads and pustules, my poor chin, jaw and cheeks need some love. 

I am planning on seeing a dermatologist VERY soon but these trips are expensive and it can be challenging finding a doctor that aligns with my care needs. 

Plus I'd prefer the most holistic approach possible but understand that may not be as effective or instant as I want.

I'm just wondering if anyone out there has experienced anything like this, or can shed some knowledge or DIY tricks. Anything!

I think my pregnancy really took a toll on my body.. I have a hunch the problem is a mixture of hormonal imbalances, gut issues, diet, and sweat (from working out all the time to lose this mom belly ðŸ˜…).

I have this huge acne scar on my upper forehead that has been driving me insane. it originally started as a huge cystic pimple back in january and while the redness has most subsided, it left a huge 3D bump that does not seem to decrease in size. itâ€™s not tender to the touch and it feels like a hard lump. it seems like some sort of scar tissue that formed, but iâ€™m also not sure if it is a keloid (?)

its been almost 6 months and iâ€™m so scared that itâ€™s going to be permanent. does anyone know what i can do to flatten it? or any treatments i can get? ",1748910487.0,1,1,t2_ptx9lgny,oneof_akind,https://www.reddit.com/user/oneof_akind
