1l30h2k,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l30h2k/personal_are_expensive_skincare_products_really/,"We all know K-beauty has some pretty high-end products, but do they really live up to the price tag? Or are there affordable dupes that deliver similar results?

Honestly, the most basic core of skincare is moisturizing after all. It’s important to use products with certain ingredients depending on your age or skin concerns, but you don’t always need to spend money on products with a ton of ingredients, especially if you don’t have any specific skin issues.

Personally, I’ve tried both expensive products and affordable dupes. Some high-end products definitely impressed me, but I’ve also found that there are budget-friendly options that work just as well, if not better. In many cases, the key is the ingredients, and you don’t need to pay for extra marketing or fancy packaging when a simpler formula does the job.

If you're looking for cost-effective beauty products, I actually recommend checking out Daiso rather than Olive Young. Olive Young is great when you're in Korea, but Daiso is a hidden gem. Most of the products there are made by the same brands you’ll find in Olive Young, but they’re way more affordable and still deliver great results.

It’s all about finding what works for your skin, whether it’s a splurge or a dupe.",08:40:47,1,1,t2_1poolxfbj0,Strange_Storage_214,https://www.reddit.com/user/Strange_Storage_214

I submitted my master thesis a few days ago (yeehaw) and now it is time to crawl out of the pit I’ve been in for the past month or so.

The stress, lack of sleep, limited exercise, poor diet (stuffing cold rotisserie chicken into my face and calling it a meal) has definitely taken its toll.

I look dull. My dark circles are bad and they look like caves under my eyes. My hair…I actually can’t even get into it. But the point is that I’m looking rough and need to get my shit back together.

What is your advice? I started working full time the day after i submitted, so as much as my soul feels like I need to be in a medically induced coma, I can’t spend all day napping.

I’m ready to work from the inside out as well, but at the same time for maximum efficiency.

1l2z940,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l2z940/routine_help_how_i_apply_my_skincare_for_best/,"Over the years, I’ve learned a few tricks to make sure my skincare routine actually works. Here’s what’s been helping me get the most out of my products:

1. Light to Heavy, Water to Oil Start with the lightest, most watery products (like toners or serums) and finish with the heaviest (like oils or creams). This way, everything absorbs better and doesn’t sit on top of your skin.
2. Let Each Product Absorb After applying each product, gently tap your skin with your fingertips to help it sink in. Don’t rush, give it a minute or so before moving to the next step.
3. Clean Hands, Always I make sure to wash my hands before applying anything to my face. It sounds simple, but it keeps my skincare clean and free from bacteria.
4. Prep Your Skin with a Water Mask Before putting on any products, I’ll do a quick just water mask. It’s super easy, just soak a cotton pad with soft water (not regular tap water) and leave it on your skin for about 5-10 minutes. It helps my skin get ready for everything else and gives my products a better chance to work.
5. Switch It Up With the Seasons I don’t use the same products year-round. In winter, I go for thicker creams and richer moisturizers. In summer, I opt for lighter, gel-based products to avoid clogging my pores.
6. Apply Right After Washing Right after I wash my face, I get to my skincare routine fast. My skin’s still a little damp, which helps the products soak in better and work more effectively.

Hope this helps! It’s all about layering and making sure your skin’s prepped and ready to absorb. Let me know if you’ve tried any of these tips!",07:15:26,2,1,t2_e41dfr0o,Yoongteol,https://www.reddit.com/user/Yoongteol

I am not big into skincare but lately I've been very bothered by ""chicken skin"" under my eyes (thin skin making my oil glands more visible). After doing some research I've concluded that I should start focusing more on sun protection in that area, but since I've had this for as long as I can remember and it is pretty significant I figured trying out an eye cream for it might also help. I heard a lot of good things about the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum with retinaldehyde. The thing is, I've never used any kind of retinoids and I have heard some bad experiences people have had with this cream and retinal in general. I'm pretty sure I have dry to normal skin if that helps. I wouldn't say I have sensitive skin, but I also haven't experimented much so it's hard for me to say with certainty that specific types of products won't affect me badly. I have had moderate problems with dry eyes when I used to live in a dry climate for school, but as of now I haven't had issues with that for a long time.

1l2ujfh,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l2ujfh/acne_what_actually_works_for_hypertrophic_acne/,"I have had raised hypertrophic acne scars on my chin since the 5th grade. I dealt with severe cystic acne from a very young age and had to go on accutane 3 different times to finally get it to kick the bucket. Unfortunately, I can never forget the years of suffering because of the scars that have been left on my chin. :(

Here is what I have tried for the raised scars:

1. Few treatments of steroid injections (no result)
2. Silicone Gel (no result)
3. 5 years of consistent microneedling sessions (no result)
4. Multiple sessions of the Tixel laser (no result)

What am I missing here? I need some guidance!!

FYI - I did manage to get rid of the hair growth on my face with laser hair removal so that is something at least, lol",02:36:03,6,3,t2_hv4n6wek,SchmackAttack,https://www.reddit.com/user/SchmackAttack
1l2ufum,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l2ufum/routine_help/,"so I’ve been using the panoxyl salicylic acid for the last couple months - love it. I just picked up the panoxyl benzoyl peroxide wash (used it before years ago and loved it, just stopped buying it lol), and the ordinary azelaic acid suspension 10%. I also use the la roche posay foaming cleanser for normal to oily skin as my normal cleanser &amp; neutrogena hydro boost water gel moisturizer (also neutrogena hydro boost spf in the morning since I’ve had skin cancer already lol) Im just a little confused on the order I should be using these lol. I’m assuming it’s something like - normal cleanser, benzoyl peroxide (only using it twice a week), salicylic acid, azelaic acid, then the hydro boost moisturizer? Or do I use the azelaic acid as a moisturizer? I forgot to ask my derm what order they should go in lol",02:30:52,2,1,t2_7j9sx2gb,mantisisland,https://www.reddit.com/user/mantisisland

I have Oily dehydrated skin for reference.

My old skincare routine:
 
1. SA cleanser - (replaced with gentle cleanser)
2. Vitamin C Serum - (stopped using)
3. Azelaic Acid Serum - (stopped using)
4. Centella Ampoule - (stopped using)
5. Ceramide moisturizer 
6. Chemical Sunscreen - (stopped using)

Literally what happened to my skin?? It got so much worse even after i stopped using things on my skin… Is this a reaction to something or will my skin get better after i stopped using all the actives?

My current routine consists of Essano Rosehip Cleanser (the old version), Skin1004 Centella Brightening Toner, and Tatcha Water Cream.   
I'm honestly not sure of my skin type; I break out from stress (assumably), dehydration &amp; genetics. These breakouts get super dry, but I tend to have really oily skin?? I also reach for sensitive cleansers but both of these are.

Before you ask, yes, I have literally tried them all. Every summer since I was an infant (I am now 23), I have been lathered up with every sunscreen under the sun. This includes mineral sunscreen, all natural, plant based, cheap, expensive, you name it. Hundreds of dollars have been wasted trying to find something. Every time I THINK I have found the solution, my body builds up a resistance to it and I break out into hives, get a fever, and have severe breakouts. I have been just using Sun Bum and calling it a day, but thanks to my track record I have a reaction to it.  Luckily, I do not burn easily and have always had a darker complexion, but as I get older I worry about skin cancer, especially since I live for the sun. I desperately want to wear sunscreen, I just am at a loss for what to do. My dermatologist doesn't even know what to do. Does anyone have the same problem? Or does anyone have any recommendations? I just tried SuperGoop face sunscreen but have an itchy rash after only wearing it twice.
