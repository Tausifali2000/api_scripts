1l265v2,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l265v2/acne_adults_with_acne_help/,"Hello! 

I have very sensitive, very acne prone, combo skin. Whiteheads, blackheads, pores, bumpy forehead, painful cystic acne, redness, irritation, itchiness, you name it. I am allergic to salicylic acid so it’s very difficult to find products that target acne w/o it.

I’ve been dealing w pretty bad acne since high school. In 2022 during college, my dermatologist cleared my skin almost completely by having me use a topical cream called clindamycin 1% and benzoyl peroxide gel 5%. I was so confident in my skin I didn’t feel like I needed to wear makeup, something I’d never experienced before. I was also using all cerave products: 


- Foaming Facial Cleanser 
- Resurfacing Retinol Cream for scaring 
- Facial Mosturizer w/ SPF 30 in the morning 
- Facial mosturizer PM at night 


Something dried me out and gave me red patches all around my face and the corners of my lips. After a year of no issues with the topical cream, the dermo took me off of it and suggested I use vanicream instead of cerave. The acne slowly came back within 2 years.

I also have GERD and digestive issues, which i’ve read can cause hormonal acne. 

I’m now 22 without a dermatologist and my skin is getting as bad as it was in high school. I wash my face twice daily and I just keep getting new acne, along with groups that won’t go away for months. Small bruises also randomly appear under the acne groups. 

Currently, I use : 


- Byoma Jelly Cleanser (morning)
- Curology Hydro+ Foaming Gel Cleanser (morning/night) 
- Cocokind rose water toner (morning)
- Vanicream moisturizing lotion (morning/night) 
- Neutrogena Clear Face Sunscreen SPF 50 (morning -mixed w vanicream) 

I don’t know what I’m doing and need help. Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated! ",07:55:58,1,2,t2_6hz4kj65,SnooBananas5079,https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooBananas5079

A bit painful. To be fair I’m very busy so I’m constantly very stressed and during the time I got it I definitely was more stressed. I feel like this can’t be the only thing giving me acne though.

1l24mfc,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l24mfc/misc_anybody_else_have_a_particularly_dry_nose/,"I’ve been trying to tackle the blackheads I’ve had consistently for the past decade. I have noticed a lot of success using BHAs on my cheeks for those blackheads, but my nose absolutely hates exfoliants. I recently moved to a windy climate and my nose is constantly “chapped”. I should also mention that I have had very sensitive eczema prone skin since I was born. I don’t know if I have eczema on my nose, but it frequently is peeling, flaking or just noticeably red. I take a lot of precautions, and have finally found soothing products that usually can prevent this from happening, but it still “flares up” so to speak. 

The problem is that I’m not tackling the blackheads and huge pores on my nose. I feel like my nose is covered in a barrier of cortisone and aquaphor most of the time. I try to only use these at night but I do use an occlusive sunscreen that is essentially shielding my nose from the weather during the day .

I use a 2% salicylic that has worked well to help clear my blackheads. I use it every other day. I usually avoid my nose, or do my nose less often because it gets irritated almost instantly. I have had to avoid using my toner on my nose too and I just know I’m not getting the full benefit out of my products because of my weird skin. My skin care products work so well on the rest of my face and this has been so frustrating for me.

1l23hyt,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l23hyt/routine_help_baby_oil_baby_powder_moisturizer/,"I got into Korean skincare recently and started a routine with basically the same AM/PM routine (oil cleanse only in PM).

I used to wash and moisturize with Cetaphil products (and then baby powder on top because I didn't like the greasiness) for years until I got an allergic reaction for some reason (skin and eyes were puffy) and switched to washing just with water and using Glaxal base lotion until my face calmed down.

Now I oil cleanse with J&amp;J baby oil (PM only), water cleanse with Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser, use BoJ Green Plum Refreshing Toner, then moisturize with Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream.

I'm on my second month of this routine. My texture is better, barrier is restored, and people tell me I have the dewy glow/glass skin, but I think it's just me being oily without the baby powder...

I'm just wondering if baby powder is ok as the last step to skin care? Or is it absorbing/cancelling out my moisturizer? Also is baby oil ok for oil cleansing?

I'm also starting to think the Round Lab cream is too heavy for summer. I'm getting small whiteheads from being too oily as it gets warmer out. This cream might be better in the winter (because I get frequent wind burn too when I dry out).

Recs for summer moisturizer?

Note: I did the skin type test (cleansed + waited 2 hours) and I think I have normal/combo sensitive skin?

Note 2: Never wore sunscreen until now and use Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Mild-Up Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++ just in the afternoon when I go home. Sun isn't up when I leave in the AM (UV 0).

1l23776,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l23776/acne_what_finally_worked_for_my_acneprone_skin/,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share something deeply personal today, not just to tell my story, but in hopes that someone reading this who is struggling like I was might find a bit of light at the end of the tunnel.

I have always battled acne. Not just the occasional pimple, but full-blown cystic breakouts that felt like they were in control of my self-worth. I remember avoiding mirrors, turning down invites, and mastering the art of fake laughter because the thought of someone really looking at me made my chest tighten. I tried so many products, routines, and so-called holy grail hacks, but my skin would either dry out, break out more, or just look dull and tired.

It wasn’t until I shifted my mindset from ""how do I get rid of this overnight"" to ""how can I heal my skin gently and consistently"" that things began to change.

Here’s what finally made the difference for me:

**Gentle exfoliation and deep cleansing:** I started my mornings with a cleanser that used natural salicylic acid. What surprised me was not just how clean my skin felt, but the fact that it did not feel stripped. My skin stayed soft, hydrated, and fresh, and over a few weeks, the angry under-the-skin breakouts started fading. My pores began looking smaller, and the oiliness became balanced.

**A toner that did not sting:** I had been traumatized by toners that felt like rubbing alcohol. But this one was different. It was soothing yet effective. With ingredients like grape water and rose water, it calmed my skin while gently minimizing oil and blackheads. It became a moment of self-care I actually looked forward to.

**Moisturizer that hydrates without the grease:** If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you know the struggle of finding a moisturizer that does not make things worse. This lightweight one I found is olive squalane based, and it truly feels like a drink of water for the skin. No heaviness, no clogged pores, just balanced hydration and a natural matte finish. It helped smooth out my texture and made me feel confident even without makeup.

**A glycolic essence that brightens the skin:** I will be honest. I was skeptical of essences. But this one turned out to be my favorite step. It gently exfoliates dead skin and helps the rest of the routine work better. I used it consistently before my serum, and over time, the dark spots from past breakouts began to fade. It did not happen overnight, but it happened. And that gave me hope.

I did not expect skincare to become a form of therapy. But these small, mindful steps like cleansing without punishment and treating my skin with patience helped me fall back in love with my reflection. Now I get compliments on my skin, and I do not panic when someone pulls out their camera. That is something I never thought I would say.

If anyone is feeling overwhelmed, just know that your skin does not define your worth. But taking care of it with love can absolutely help you feel more like yourself. It took time, research, and a lot of trial and error, but I found a routine that finally feels right for me.

I am happy to share more details about what I used or how I layered everything if anyone is curious. Just wanted to post this in case it helps someone feel less alone in their journey.

First two pics are now, last pic was from a week ago (sorry for bad pic wasn’t expected to do before and after). So recently I started using the new effaclar duo dual action acne cleanser that’s 4% benzoyl peroxide from la roche posay (I just found out they retired the old dual acne treatment which was 5.5%). The old treatment always worked wonders for me. My forehead has always been pretty smooth, with occasional closed comedones. However, after starting this new cleanser my forehead has gotten extremely textured in the past week with several closed comedones. No where else on my face has reacted like this (but I don’t break out in comedones really anywhere else but my nose sometimes). I tried using differin 10% benzoyl as well because I was wondering if the percentage wasn’t enough but it hasn’t helped (but it has been working on a couple pimples I had on my chin). This is in addition to using niacinamide serum and la roche posay moisturizer (which do not bother me/have never bothered me in the past). I am wondering if i should STOP using this products and if so what to use instead? Or if this is simply purging of closed comedones on my forehead since benzoyl peroxide is supposed to clear those out. 

I am never a huge skin care user aside from cleansing my face with SA cleanser. I only started using these products because my menstrual cycle was causing me to break out on my chin, and the benzoyl peroxide treatment in the past always worked great for me.

Has anyone tried the eBay version, is it authentic? The lower price seems like a red flag.",02:25:35,2,2,t2_87axz0py,Dmik224,https://www.reddit.com/user/Dmik224
