e0e93uh,"For my grad makeup I‚Äôm wearing a light coverage foundation just to cover the scars, but the difference in texture of my skin in both pics is so so astounding!! I started accutane January 2nd, 2018, and just finished it on June 4th. Still got those dry lips though. 

For my routine I‚Äôve kept it pretty simple:
 
AM
Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser
Cetaphil Daily Facial Mosturizer with SPF

PM
Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser
Thayers Lavender Witch Hazel
Cetaphil Daily Facial Mosturizer with SPF

Edit : Wow I just want to thank everyone for their really kind words. I really appreciate all the support and the positivity being spread around, it‚Äôs such an amazing feeling to be happy with your own skin again!! 

I‚Äôve been having problems with acne for about 5 years now, and for anyone asking or worrying about accutane, I personally wish I‚Äôd started it sooner. Of course, I‚Äôm not an expert and you should definitely talk with a dermatologist about the drug, but in my case it was really worth it! To just be able to go to the grocery store without any makeup on and not worry about people looking at you is a feeling I haven‚Äôt had in a while. 

I‚Äôm extremely thankful that I was able to feel so confident in my dress, standing with my beautiful friends as we went to our graduation banquet last night. It was an amazing experience, and I‚Äôm just happy that high school is coming to an end! 

So again, thank you to everyone for the congratulations, I‚Äôm glad to have shared some of my experience with anyone else going through the same thing right now.

e0evb7u,"For your lips try pure lanolin. They sell it in target as nipple balm for breastfeeding women in the femine hygiene isle, it's been life changing for me. I have naturally dry skin and I'm on tretinoin so the lanolin makes a big difference for me. 

My favorite way to use it is to apply something thin and moisturizing underneath (when I finish my face moisturizer I cut it open and let it dry out a bit and use this as it has grapeseed oil or I use the Aven√© lip butter) then apply the lanolin on top as a protective layer. It protects like vasaline would but better and it also moisturizes so it's amazing. I also like to use it to make my own homemade lip balms (I add marula oil, borage seed oil, and mix in some of the Nivea lip butter and even a bit of Nuxe Reve de miel).

e0fctbt,Yeah it comes from sheep's wool but its treated somehow so it doesn't smell and I know it sounds a bit gross but it's commenly used it lots of skincare products since it's similar to our own oils. If it hadn't been such a Holly Grail for me I'd think it was weird or gross but it's the only thing that's worked for my super dry lips and when your lips are as dry as mine were (especially back when I was playing clarinet and saxophone) you'll do almost anything to get proper long term relief from dryness. The lanolin is thick enough that it will stay put while I'm sleeping and it's actually still there when I wake up and it's the only product that has done that for me.,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8pv3gg/ba_finished_my_5_month_course_of_accutane_just_in/e0fctbt/,1528625920.0,7,t2_13v8lo,throwawayacc97n5,https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawayacc97n5,https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawayacc97n5,1

my brother went on accutane. he didn‚Äôt have any harsh side effects, but they still made all of the risks clear to him. if i remember correctly, he had to go in *monthly* to see his doctor, review the possible side effects and risks, and sign off to continue. accutane is one medication they‚Äôre super careful with because of the risks. it‚Äôs usually a last-resort. complications aren‚Äôt super common, it‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre much worse with this drug. it‚Äôs horrible.",/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8pv3gg/ba_finished_my_5_month_course_of_accutane_just_in/e0f641c/,1528611317.0,5,t2_u3h7j,parmesann,https://www.reddit.com/user/parmesann,https://www.reddit.com/user/parmesann,0

e0eda2u,"&gt;I know it‚Äôs a dangerous drug

Is it really that dangerous though? I think they need to do updated studies because some of the ""side effects"" like suicidal tendencies had so many confounding variables (aka depression over your terrible cystic acne that's unresponsive to other treatments) I think it gives the drug a bad rap. I believe the biggest proven danger is to unborn children which is why patients need to be so careful to avoid getting pregnant (and why you can't donate blood while on Accutane).

You know what's a dangerous drug? [Tylenol](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/tylenol-overdose_n_3976991), many times over. Yet no one really seems too concerned about it which is odd.",/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8pv3gg/ba_finished_my_5_month_course_of_accutane_just_in/e0eda2u/,1528576228.0,8,t2_3e4b1,just1nw,https://www.reddit.com/user/just1nw,https://www.reddit.com/user/just1nw,2
e0emofr,"Yeah I‚Äôm a nurse.

e0eokg8,"Yeah, the teratogenic effects are particularly bad, it's right up there with Thalidomide in terms of severity. I think that's where a lot of the reticence towards Accutane comes from, just the surprise birth defects that arose when it first came on the market. 

&gt;I‚Äôm in school for nurse practitioner and we can prescribe narcotics and benzodiazepines etc but we are supposed to refer these patients to a dermatologist for their prescription.

This is just crazy to me as opiods and benzos are objectively way, way more dangerous for patients (short and long term).

e0ex8e6,"first of all congratulations, you look amazing.

i mean zero disrespect by this AT ALL. i have a genuine question. 

all of the most severe cases of cystic acne that i have seen have been on Asian people. is there perhaps something genetic that makes people of Asian descent more susceptible to cystic acne?
