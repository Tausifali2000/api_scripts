They sell it in target as nipple balm for breastfeeding women in the femine hygiene isle, it's been life changing for me. I have naturally dry skin and I'm on tretinoin so the lanolin makes a big difference for me. 

My favorite way to use it is to apply something thin and moisturizing underneath (when I finish my face moisturizer I cut it open and let it dry out a bit and use this as it has grapeseed oil or I use the Aven√© lip butter) then apply the lanolin on top as a protective layer. It protects like vasaline would but better and it also moisturizes so it's amazing. I also like to use it to make my own homemade lip balms (I add marula oil, borage seed oil, and mix in some of the Nivea lip butter and even a bit of Nuxe Reve de miel). Seriously give it a try! :) Also congrats you look really lovely and I bet you feel great too! :)",/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8pv3gg/ba_finished_my_5_month_course_of_accutane_just_in/e0evb7u/,throwawayacc97n5,16

Cetaphil Daily Facial Mosturizer with SPF

Edit : Wow I just want to thank everyone for their really kind words. I really appreciate all the support and the positivity being spread around, it‚Äôs such an amazing feeling to be happy with your own skin again!! 

I‚Äôve been having problems with acne for about 5 years now, and for anyone asking or worrying about accutane, I personally wish I‚Äôd started it sooner. Of course, I‚Äôm not an expert and you should definitely talk with a dermatologist about the drug, but in my case it was really worth it! To just be able to go to the grocery store without any makeup on and not worry about people looking at you is a feeling I haven‚Äôt had in a while. 

I‚Äôm extremely thankful that I was able to feel so confident in my dress, standing with my beautiful friends as we went to our graduation banquet last night. It was an amazing experience, and I‚Äôm just happy that high school is coming to an end! 

So again, thank you to everyone for the congratulations, I‚Äôm glad to have shared some of my experience with anyone else going through the same thing right now.

my brother went on accutane. he didn‚Äôt have any harsh side effects, but they still made all of the risks clear to him. if i remember correctly, he had to go in *monthly* to see his doctor, review the possible side effects and risks, and sign off to continue. accutane is one medication they‚Äôre super careful with because of the risks. it‚Äôs usually a last-resort. complications aren‚Äôt super common, it‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre much worse with this drug. it‚Äôs horrible.",/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8pv3gg/ba_finished_my_5_month_course_of_accutane_just_in/e0f641c/,parmesann,4

I know it‚Äôs a dangerous drug but I‚Äôm sure you feel so good about yourself now and it shows. Enjoy your graduation!,/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8pv3gg/ba_finished_my_5_month_course_of_accutane_just_in/e0eb4md/,1528573970.0,6,,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/user/[deleted],e0eda2u,"&gt;I know it‚Äôs a dangerous drug

Is it really that dangerous though? I think they need to do updated studies because some of the ""side effects"" like suicidal tendencies had so many confounding variables (aka depression over your terrible cystic acne that's unresponsive to other treatments) I think it gives the drug a bad rap. I believe the biggest proven danger is to unborn children which is why patients need to be so careful to avoid getting pregnant (and why you can't donate blood while on Accutane).

You know what's a dangerous drug? [Tylenol](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/tylenol-overdose_n_3976991), many times over. Yet no one really seems too concerned about it which is odd.",/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8pv3gg/ba_finished_my_5_month_course_of_accutane_just_in/e0eda2u/,just1nw,8
