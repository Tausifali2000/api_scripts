(no surgery options, im too poor for that). ive tried facial yoga and guasha and they dont seem to help. im not sure if this counts as anti aging because im not old but that seems like the closest tag. ive attached an image of my skin, sorry for bad lighting

1kzxivv,https://i.redd.it/cbpp1xrrg44f1.jpeg,"Hello everyone,

Since years I am suffering from acne and sensitive dry skin located on my whole upper body. 
My face is totally uninfected by it.

In the warm months of the year it gets worse, I think itâ€™s because of sweating.

I started to use a cleaner with salicylic acid in the shower. The problem is, after I am finished with cleaning, my skin becomes totally dry and feeling â€žhardâ€œ.
So I put on a moisturizer immediately after the cleaning.

Do the moisturizer destroy the effect of the skin cleaning?

Are you  have experience the same problem, or have any other tips? 

PS: My diet is pretty health I would say. So no sweets/chocolate at all, only like once a month a bit.

Thank you!

Although my skin is acne-free (which is awesome), my skin has been very dry, red, and overall just dull. I've tried to be patient and keep it hydrated and use sunscreen but I haven't noticed a huge difference. I live in Canada, so our winters are long, and maybe the dry cold impacted me more than it should have.

I was wondering if anyone may have any holy grail products that brighten up and hydrate? Something to bring my skin back to life.

My current products that I use every day are basically just the Cerave Moisturizing Lotion (every morining and night), the Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, and the Supergoop Glowscreen. I occasionally use the LRP Cicaplast baume (maybe once a week).

I am also not quite ready to use any actives. I have a prescription for Differin but I'm thinking that I may start using that in the fall, as I know my skin is still quite sensitive. I was thinking maybe a gentle lactic acid but still,I'm not sure if it's too soon for that.

About three years ago, I was experiencing something similar, on a much smaller scale and at the time gentle cleansing and adapalene helped clear it up. My skin remained clear for almost two years after that. This past year my skin had seemed to spiral into.. this state. Some days itâ€™s relatively clear, and other mornings I wake up and it looks like this. Itâ€™s not painful, or itchy really â€” just very inflamed, and very widespread. 

I posted about 6 months ago and someone told me it could be rosacea type 2, and that seemed to track based on the research that i did. I do tend to get very flushed very easily, and my face will feel hot as well. 

These areas are extremely dry, and as I said, the â€˜acneâ€™ will clear up and then flare the next day or itâ€™ll just worsen as days pass. 

Iâ€™m currently using Vanicream gentle cleanser and their moisturizer, as well. Iâ€™m just at a loss because nothing seems to work. Iâ€™ve tried azelaic acid, to no real avail. Iâ€™ve tried Ivermectin, to no real avail.

To start with, Iâ€™m a 19yo trans girl, and I donâ€™t really know much, if anything, about skincare. 
I have a problem with enlarged pores and some blackheads (or at least something that looks like blackheads) around the nose, and occasional acne.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m writing this post so that I hopefully get some recommendations. So there it goes.
1. 2% BHA Acid, once a day
2. Oil cleansing with Jojoba Oil, twice a day for about 5mins.
3. Basic cleanser, twice a day
4. Toner with hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, twice a day
5. Serum with zinc and vitamin C, twice a day
6. Moisturiser with 50 SPF
7. After finishing face electrolysis, retinol serum

1kzw120,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzw120,"Hi everyone! I (23F) have had issues with the skin around my nose being constantly red and seemingly irritated for probably about 2 or 3 years now. It doesnâ€™t typically hurt much but as itâ€™s allergy season right now (pollen allergy) it does get irritated a bit more by having to blow my nose relatively regularly. No matter what products Iâ€™ve used, itâ€™s never gone away. Now Iâ€™ve gotten off hormonal birth control in December so Iâ€™m guessing thatâ€™s why my chin is now breaking out too because itâ€™s never done that before. Itâ€™s always dry as well, no matter what I put on it. Until my nose started being irritated I honestly never really had any complaints with my skin but right now itâ€™s really affecting my confidence. Iâ€™m not really sure when my undereye starting looking rough as well but itâ€™s now sore too and itâ€™s weirdly just my left eye, not my right. Could this all be allergy related? Does anyone have any clue whatâ€™s going on and what I could use? I have a dermatologist appointment booked but itâ€™s weeks away and I just want it to get better.

Additional info: My skin definitely feels dry but gets rather oily in the T-Zone at the minute. I usually wash my face at the end of the day, washing it twice makes it feel even more dry. For face washing i use the Kiehlâ€˜s Calendula Deep Cleansing Foaming Face Wash and the Kiehlâ€˜s Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil. For regular skincare I use the Kiehlâ€™s Midnight Recovery Concentrate and Ultra Facial Cream as well as the Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado. Sometimes I also use the Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% from the ordinary. About once or twice a week I also use the Direct Acids AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution also from the Ordinary.

Iâ€™m thinking about taking accutane or hormonal pills like birth control or spironolactone. I did try a course of lower dose spironolactone (&lt;100mg) but didnâ€™t see any improvement. My biggest concern for hormonal pills is that for example birth control wouldnâ€™t be prescribed for people with a history of breast cancer. I personally never had breast cancer but my family does have a history of getting breast cancer, including my mom. So Iâ€™m worried about the fact that those pills would alternate hormonal levels. Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong tho.

My dermâ€™s an advocate for accutane since she says that I would need to take spironolactone or birth control until who knows when. While the chance of relapsing for accutane is lower. So Iâ€™m debating between the two types of pills.

Iâ€™ve also had two small flat flesh colored bumps along the edge of my bottom lip line for over a year now. I decided to try to squeeze one thinking the stringy oil would come out and I regret it! Hardly anything came out, but the next two days it remained red with a white center and slight swelling. The first day, I tried a pimple patch at night and the next day I tried a dap of topicals clarifying mask, which I felt like did nothing but make it more red and swollen so I discontinued. I cleaned it here and there with peroxide, tried diluted tea tree once, and put moisturizer on it the rest of the week. I also cleaned it well when I wore makeup one day that later that week. I also tried to lay off the lip products a bit. No improvement. 

During week 2, I pretty much left it alone but did try prid to see if anything else would come out. Nothing did after two application, so I discontinued that too and left it alone for the next 5 days, just cleaning with water while in the shower and patting dry. 

Week 3, I just left it alone and hoped that it would go away. 

Itâ€™s been almost 4 weeks now and itâ€™s still visible, red and feels like a swollen under skin pimple when I smile. It doesnâ€™t hurt or burn, but did sting a bit after cleaning off makeup that I tried to cake on it yesterday. It seemed like a little bit of the stringy stuff came out the center after cleaning the makeup off, so I applied a pimple patch and woke up to no improvement still. (All pics from different angles this morning).

The one next to it is how it looked before I messed with it. I didnâ€™t try to pop or squeeze that one, so you can see how it looked prior to me messing with it!
