If you would like to support this channel check out my merchandise store! 

This channel is all about new car reviews that are easy to follow, simple to digest and perfect for those who need to know if a specific car, ute, SUV, 4x4, van or pick-up is right for them.

The Right Car is hosted by Matt Campbell, a motoring journalist and presenter who has almost 15 years of experience helping people decide on their next set of wheels. Matt goes through the stuff you want to know - but also the important stuff you NEED to know.

After working at Drive.com.au, CarAdvice, CarsGuide and now contributing to CarExpert and GoAuto, Matt decided it was time to launch his own channel aimed directly at people who need help choosing their new car. And that's where The Right Car comes in!
